## Hardware
We are only supporting RaspberryPis. Currently we are using a standard RaspberryPi 3 Model B. It is connected to a custom build shield (hat) that provides power and communication over our CAN Bus.

For more information about the shield have a look at the [`mfs-hardware`](https://github.com/tub-uas/mfs-hardware) repository.
